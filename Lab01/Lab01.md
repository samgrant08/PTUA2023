## Lab01: Setting up

### Objectives

 - Install the Anaconda Python Distribution on your own laptop, and start to use Juypter Notebook
 - Try to use Google Colab
 - Setup a GitHub account
 - Install a code/text editor

### Instructions

#### Anaconda

 1. Download the Anaconda on the [download page][anaconda], select the installer that is appropriate for the operating system of your machine.
 2. Read the [Anaconda Documentation][anaconda_doc].
 3. Using the installer you downloaded, install the Anaconda Python distribution.
 4. Now we explore different methods to use Python. First, explore JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, iPython interpretor (Qt Console) and Spyder IDE in the Anaconda (**Small task: print "hello world" in each of the python environment**)
 5. If you want, you can change your Anaconda working directory based on this [guide][guide](for windows system). If you have a Mac/Linux, you can always navigate to your folder through terminal and open jupyter notebook from there (more details will be covered in week 2).
 6. Download the course repository from [qszhao/PTUA2023][repo] as a zip file and put it into your Anaconda working directory.
 7. Start a jupyter notebook and try to open PTUA Lecture 1.ipynb and run through it (hint: use shift-enter). 
 8. Try to write markdown and LaTeX math in the Jupyter Notebook based on the [Markdown_guide][markdown] and the [LaTeX][LaTex_math].
 9. Create at least one visualization from the Matplotlib [visualization gallary][gallary]. Try to run it both from the source code and jupyter notebook. 

 
#### Git
 1. Sign up for a GitHub account at https://github.com/join.
 2. Find the [qszhao/PTUA2023][repo] repo on GitHub website and fork it to your own repo.
 3. Git installation: if you have a Windows system, please install Git Bash from this [link][gitbash]. If you have a Mac, please install Xcode commandline tools from [here][commandline tools].

#### Code/text editor
 1. Download a code/text editor ([VSCode][VSCode] or [Sublime Text][Sublime]).
 2. Download the Markdown file from the [qszhao/PTUA2023][repo] and try to open the Lab01.md from the text editor.
 3. Create a new Markdown file with your student ID as file name, and type in your course goals in the markdown file. 

#### Google Colab
 1. Set up or use your existing Google account to enter [Google Colab][colab].
 2. Start a new jupyter notebook in your Google Colab.
 3. Copy and Paste the content in PTUA Lecture 1.ipynb and obtain the same results.
 
#### Hint
 1. You may receive trackbacks or error messages during your coding exercises. The first thing you can do is to ask Google (or ChatGPT?) smartly. You will find your answer from Google most of the time. [Stack overflow][stackoverflow] is one of the most common websites we use to find solutions as well.
